	<h1>Networking Esentials</h1>  

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Hi and welcome hir is my work in prgres. In this chapter I will include My notes and underlines from books. NOW no more talking straight to buissnes</p>
	<h2>Networking protocols and Architecture</h2>

	    <p>1. <strong>Ethernet -</strong>Network interface </p> 

	    <p>2. <strong>IP -</strong> From source to detanation </p> 

	    <p>3. <strong>TCP -</strong> Checks is all there  </p>

	    <p>4. <strong>HTTP -</strong> Aplicanion by software </p>

 

	<h2>Tcp/IP Model </h2>

	    <p>4. Aplication Represents data to the end user </p>

	    <p>3. Transport Suports Comunication Btwen Devices </p>

	    <p>2. Internet Determent best path thru network  </p>

	    <p>1. Network acces Controls Hardware </p>

 

    <h3>The Protocols stack  </h3>

	    <p>Sucesfull comunication between host and Clijent rewuires interaction between a number of protocols and implemented 
            in software and are implemented in softwre 					
            and hardware that are instaled on each device. That interaction Betwen protocols and a single device can be 
            ilustrated as a protocol stack. 
        </p>

 

	<h2>The OSI Model  </h2>

	    <p>7. <strong>Aplication -</strong> Contains protocols used for proces to proces Comunication. The aplication layer is 
            the level of the protocol hierarchy where user-accesed network proces reside. In this text, a TCP/IP aplication is any 
            network process that occures above the transport layer. This include all of the processesthat users directly interact 
            with, as well as other processes at this level that users are not nesesary aware of.
        </p>

	    <p>6. <strong>Presentation</strong> Provides for comon representation of the data transfered betwen aplication layer 
            and services. For cooperating applications to echchange data, they must agre about how data is represented. In OSI 
            model , this layer provides standard data presentation routines. This function is frequwntly hendled within the 
            apliccation in TCP/IP, though increasingly TCP/IP protocols such as XDR and MIME Perform this function.
        </p>

	    <p>5. <strong>Session</strong> Provides services to the presentation layer to organize and menage data exchane. As with 
            presentation Layer, the session Layer is not identifiable as separate layer in the TCP/IP protocol hierarchy. 
            The OSI session Layer menages the sessions (connection) between cooperating applications. In TCP /IP, this funcion 
            largly occures in the Tranport Layer, and the term 'session' is not used. For TCP/IP, The terms socket and port are 
            used to describe the path over which cooperating applications communicate. 
        </p>

	    <p>4. <strong>Transport</strong> Defines services to segment , transfer and reasamble the dat for individual comunication 
            betwen the end devices. Much of our discusion of TCP/IP is directed to the protocols that occur in the Transport 
            Layer. The Transport Layer in the OSI reference model guarantees that reciver gets the data exactly as it was sent. 
            In the TCP/IP this function is preformed by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). However, TCP/IP Offers a second 
            Transport Layer service, User datagram protocol (UDP), that does not preform by the end-to end realability checks. 
        
        </p>

	    <p>3. <strong>Network</strong> Provide Servics to exchange the idividual pices od data over the netwoerk betwen individual end divices. </p>

	    <p>2. <strong>Data Link</strong>  Laer protocols describe methods for exchange data frames betwen devices over a common media. </p>

	    <p>1. <strong>Pchysical</strong> protocol describe mechanical and electrical funcional proceddural means to active omineine and deactive physical conections for bit transitions 	to and from network devices. </p>
