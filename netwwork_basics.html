    <p>Hi and welcome hir is my work in prgres. In this chapter I will include My notes and underlines from books. NOW no more talking straight to buissnes</p>
	
 

	<h2>Tcp/IP Model </h2>

	    <p>4. Aplication Represents data to the end user </p>

	    <p>3. Transport Suports Comunication Btwen Devices </p>

	    <p>2. Internet Determent best path thru network  </p>

	    <p>1. Network acces Controls Hardware </p>

 

    <h3>The Protocols stack  </h3>

	    <p>Sucesfull comunication between host and Clijent rewuires interaction between a number of protocols and implemented 
            in software and are implemented in softwre 					
            and hardware that are instaled on each device. That interaction Betwen protocols and a single device can be 
            ilustrated as a protocol stack. 
        </p>

 

	<h2>The OSI Model  </h2>

	    <p>
            7. <strong>Aplication -</strong> Contains protocols used for proces to proces Comunication. The aplication layer is 
            the level of the protocol hierarchy where user-accesed network proces reside. In this text, a TCP/IP aplication is any 
            network process that occures above the transport layer. This include all of the processesthat users directly interact 
            with, as well as other processes at this level that users are not nesesary aware of.
        </p>

	    <p>6. <strong>Presentation</strong> Provides for comon representation of the data transfered betwen aplication layer 
            and services. For cooperating applications to echchange data, they must agre about how data is represented. In OSI 
            model , this layer provides standard data presentation routines. This function is frequwntly hendled within the 
            apliccation in TCP/IP, though increasingly TCP/IP protocols such as XDR and MIME Perform this function.
        </p>

	    <p>
            5. <strong>Session</strong> Provides services to the presentation layer to organize and menage data exchane. As with 
            presentation Layer, the session Layer is not identifiable as separate layer in the TCP/IP protocol hierarchy. 
            The OSI session Layer menages the sessions (connection) between cooperating applications. In TCP /IP, this funcion 
            largly occures in the Tranport Layer, and the term 'session' is not used. For TCP/IP, The terms socket and port are 
            used to describe the path over which cooperating applications communicate. 
        </p>

	    <p>
            4. <strong>Transport</strong> Defines services to segment , transfer and reasamble the dat for individual comunication 
            betwen the end devices. Much of our discusion of TCP/IP is directed to the protocols that occur in the Transport 
            Layer. The Transport Layer in the OSI reference model guarantees that reciver gets the data exactly as it was sent. 
            In the TCP/IP this function is preformed by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). However, TCP/IP Offers a second 
            Transport Layer service, User datagram protocol (UDP), that does not preform by the end-to end realability checks. 
        
        </p>

	    <p>
            3. <strong>Network</strong> Provide Servics to exchange the idividual pices od data over the netwoerk betwen individual end divices.
            The Network Layer menages connection across the network and isolates the uper layer protocols from the details of underlaying network. 
            The Internet Protocol (IP), wich isolates the uper layers from the underlayin nwtwork and handles the addressing and delivery of data, is usually
            described as TCP/IP Network Layer.
        </p>

	    <p>
            2. <strong>Data Link</strong>  Laer protocols describe methods for exchange data frames betwen devices over a common media. The reliable
            Delivery of data across the underlying physical network is handled by the data link layer. TCP/IP rarely creates protocols in the Data Link Layer.
            Most RFCs that relate to the Data Link Layer discuss how IP can make use of existing data.
        </p>
        <p>
            1.<strong>Pchysical</strong> protocol describe mechanical and electrical funcional proceddural means to active sustane and deactive physical 
            connection
            for bit Transmission to and from network device.The Phisical Layer defines the characteristics of the hardware nedded to carry the data trannsmission 
            signal. Features such as voltage levels, and the number and location of interface pins, are defined in this layer. Examples of standards at the 
            Physical
            Layer are interface connectors such as RS232C and V.35 and standards for local area natwork wiring such as IEEE 802.3. TCP/IP does not define 
            physical 
            standards-it make use of existing standards. 
        </p>
       <p>
        The terminology of the OSI reference model helps us describe TCP/IP, but to fully understand it, we must use an Architectural model that more 
        closely matches 
        the structure of TCP/IP.

       <h1>Ethernet</h1>
       <p>
        Ther is no oficial local are networking standard but ther is one more common then others. Ethernet protocol define how data is formated and how 
        is transmited
        over the wired network. The Ethernet standard specifies protocol that operate at layer 1 and layer 2 of the OSi model.
       </p>
       <h1>Ethernet Addresing (MAC)</h1>
 	<p>
		All comunication requires a way to identyfy the suorce and destynation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Media Access Control(Mac)- Done by NIC card level.Checking mac address without checking incapsulaed data.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Encapsulation</h1>
    <p>
        When sending a letter writer uses an accepted format to ensure that letter is delivered and understood by the recipient. The same way message is 
        send over a computer 
        network.  
	</p>
    <p>
        The process of placing one message format (the letter) inside another message format (the envelope) is called encapsulation. Message is encapsulated 
        in specific format, 
        called frame.   
    </p>
    <h1>Ethernet Frame</h1>
    <p>
        The Ethernet protocol standard define many aspects of network communication including frame format, size, timing and encoding.      
    </p>
    <h1>Hierarchical Network Design </h1>
    <h2>Hierarchical addresses </h2>
    <p>
        Physical address: On Host the Mac address does not change it is physically assigned to the host NIC The physical address remains the same.
        Logical Address is signed logically based where the host is located. The IP address or network address is assigned to each host by a network administrator based on local network.
        Both the physical MAC and logical IP addresses are required on hierarchical network to communicate. 
    </p>
    <h2>Hierarchical Layers.</h2>
            <p><strong>Access Layer</strong>-This layer provides communications to hosts in local ethernet networks.</p>
            <p><strong>Distribution layer</strong>- This Layer interconnects the smaller local networks.</p>
            <p><strong>Core layer</strong>-This layer provides high-speed connection between distribution layer devices. 
                    With this design, there is no need for logical address in scheme that can identify location of a host.</p>
    <h2>The access layers</h2>
    <p>
        This is basic level of the network it is part of network in which people gain access to other hosts and to shared files and printers. This layer provides the first layer of networking. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ethernet swich </h2>
    <p>
        An ethernet swich is device used on the access layer when host sends a message to another host connected to the same network	, the swich accepts and decodes the frames to read the physical (MAC) address portion of the message.
    </p>
    <h2>The MAC address table </h2>
    <p>
        A swich build MAC address table by examining the source MAC address of each frame that is sent between hosts. When new host sends a message or responds to a flooded message, the swich immediately learns MAC address and port to which is connected. The table is dynamically updated. 

Functions preformed at this level include encapsulation of IP datagrams into the frames transmitted by network and mapping of IP addresses to the physical addresses used by the network.
