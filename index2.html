    <h2>Network types</h2>

    <p>Al networks are built on the same principles. You can apply these principles to design and build your organizations local or cloud-based networks. When you build a network, you need to know about the different types of networks, their topologies, and their uses. </p>
    <h2>What is a network?</h2> 

    A network is a collection of network-enabled devices, typically made up of computers, switches, routers, printers, and servers. Networks are a fundamental part of day-to-day life and exist in homes, workplaces, and public areas. Networks allow all types of network-enabled devices to communicate. 

 

 

    Network types 

    Network types vary in size, shape, and usage. To make it easier to identify  

    network types, theyâ€™re categorized into one of the following categories: 

    Personal area network 

    Local area networks 

Metropolitan area networks 

Wide area network 

<h2>What is personal area network? </h2>

A personal area network (pan) provides networking needs around individual. An example of Pan is where a smartphone, smartwatch, tablet, and laptop will connect and share data without the need to connect to an access point or other third-party network service. Pan network typically use Bluetooth to communicate because it provides a low power, short range data sharing capability. The network standards associated with Pan are Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15. 

 

 

what is local area network? 

A local area network (LAN) provides networking needs around a single location. This location might be an organizations office. A school, a university, hospital, and many others. A Lan is usually privately owned and needs authentication ad authorization to access. Of the different classifications of a network, a LAN is by far the most commonly used. 

 

 

<h2>What is metropolitan area network? </h2>

<p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) provides networking capabilities between two different locations with a city or metropolitan area to provide a single extensive network. Typically. A MAN requires a dedicated and secure connection between each LAN jointed to the MAN. </p>

 

 

<h2>What is a wide area network? </h2>

<p>A wide area network (WAN) provides networking capabilities between two different geographical locations or worldwide. For example, a WAN is used to connect an organizations head office with branch offices all over the country. A WAN links multiple LANs together to relate one super network. As a WAN, you use virtual private network (VPN) to manage connection between different LANs. </p>

 

 

<h2>Differences between LAN and WAN networks.</h2> 
<p>Several aspects set LAN apart from WAN. Knowing what these items are makes it esier to plan the services to deploy across these networks. </p>
